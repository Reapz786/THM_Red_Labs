This is a machine that allows you to practise web app hacking and privilege escalation

In these set of tasks you'll learn the following:
- brute forcing 
- hash cracking 
- service enumeration
- Linux Enumeration
The main goal here is to learn as much as possible.

Note: This format may emit false positives, so it will keep trying even after finding a
possible candidate.
Warning: detected hash type "SSH", but the string is also recognized as "ssh-opencl"
Use the "--format=ssh-opencl" option to force loading these as that type instead
Using default input encoding: UTF-8
Loaded 1 password hash (SSH [RSA/DSA/EC/OPENSSH (SSH private keys) 32/64])
Cost 1 (KDF/cipher [0=MD5/AES 1=MD5/3DES 2=Bcrypt/AES]) is 0 for all loaded hashes
Cost 2 (iteration count) is 1 for all loaded hashes
Will run 2 OpenMP threads

Yes. That was it...The password was right there under my nose....anyway completed my first room with a huge amount of cheating *ahem* I mean guidance :)                                               ![[Basic Pentesting room completed.png]]

> [!success]
> Technical / Process Skills:
Web enumeration: Using directory brute-forcing (gobuster) to find hidden dev resources.
Protocol enumeration: SMB enumeration with enum4linux and smbclient to extract usernames and files.
Credential attack: Recognized usernames from SMB, then applied password cracking (John the Ripper) against SSH private key.
SSH key handling: Extracting and using a private key, understanding encrypted key passphrase concepts.
Post-authentication enumeration: Exploring user directories, recognizing sensitive files (.bak), and reading them to complete objectives.
Prioritization: Learned to focus on the access you already have (kay shell) instead of overcomplicating with unnecessary exploits.
Soft / Process Skills:
Patience under uncertainty: Sticking with enumeration and tools rather than giving up.
Learning through iterative discovery: Figuring out when to pivot between services (web → SMB → SSH).
Documentation discipline: Maintaining notes, linking findings to specific files (dev.txt, j.txt, pass.bak).

> [!TLDR]
Performed full-stack penetration testing simulation: web directory enumeration, SMB user and file discovery, SSH key exploitation, and post-auth user enumeration. Developed methodical, structured approach to pivoting between services, identifying sensitive files, and extracting credentials safely. Documented all findings in a reproducible workflow for analysis and reporting.
